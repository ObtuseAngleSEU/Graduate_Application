# Graduate Application

My summary of 2021 Fall graduate school application process. Link to my article at [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/350439006) (written in Chinese). I provide the documents I used in different folders.

If you have any questions and want to discuss with me, feel free to drop me an email at dazitu616@gmail.com (though I may not be timely to reply).
